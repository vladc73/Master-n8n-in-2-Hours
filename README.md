•	Guide viewers through the process of creating AI agents within n8n, showcasing real-world applications such as automating inventory management and integrating with services like OpenAI and Airtable.

•	Provide insights into best practices for testing, deploying, and scaling automated workflows.

## Key Features Covered in the Tutorial
The tutorial covers a wide range of topics, including:
•	Setting up triggers and actions to initiate workflows.

•	Mapping variables and utilizing functions, filters, and switches for data processing.

•	Implementing webhooks and HTTP requests to connect with external services.

•	Building AI agents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, integrating with tools like Google Drive, and handling PDF documents.

•	Exploring advanced features such as iterators, array aggregators, and custom code execution within workflows.

By following this tutorial, viewers can develop a solid foundation in using n8n for workflow automation, enabling them to streamline tasks, improve efficiency, and leverage AI capabilities in their personal or professional projects.


## Tools Integrated in the Tutorial
The video demonstrates the integration of several tools within n8n workflows, including:

•	OpenAI: For natural language processing tasks, enabling the AI agents to understand and generate human-like text.

•	Google Drive: Used for storing and retrieving documents, facilitating document management within workflows.

•	PDF Document Handling: Incorporating PDF documents into workflows, allowing AI agents to process and extract information from PDFs.

•	Vector Stores: Utilized for storing and retrieving data in vector format, supporting advanced search and retrieval operations.

•	Webhooks and HTTP Requests: For connecting with external services and APIs, enabling the AI agents to interact with various platforms.

## AI Agents Created
The tutorial guides viewers through the creation of AI agents with capabilities such as:

•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI Agent: An AI agent that combines retrieval mechanisms with generative models to provide contextually relevant responses.

•	Document Processing Agent: An agent capable of handling PDF documents, extracting information, and integrating it into workflows
.
•	Data Management Agent: An agent that interacts with vector stores to store and retrieve data efficiently.

By following this tutorial, viewers can learn to build AI agents that automate complex tasks, integrate multiple services, and enhance productivity through intelligent automation.
